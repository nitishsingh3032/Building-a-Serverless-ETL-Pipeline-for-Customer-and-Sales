# Building-a-Serverless-ETL-Pipeline-for-Customer-and-Sales
🛠️ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using AWS Glue and Amazon S3. The goal is to process customer and sales data, transform it using AWS Glue, and store the cleaned and transformed results back to S3 for further analysis or visualization with tools like Power BI.

🚀 Tech Stack

AWS S3: Storage for raw and transformed data.

AWS Glue: Serverless ETL service for data transformation.

AWS IAM: Secure access management for AWS services.

Python/PySpark: For data transformation scripts.

Power BI (Optional): For visualizing the transformed data.

📂 Project Structure

├── raw-data/                    # Raw customer and sales data
├── transformed-data/            # Processed data stored back in S3
├── glue-scripts/                # AWS Glue transformation scripts
└── notebooks/                   # Jupyter notebooks for local testing

📊 Workflow

Data Ingestion: Upload raw customer and sales data (CSV, JSON, etc.) to an S3 bucket.

AWS Glue Crawler: Automatically discover the data schema and create a Data Catalog.

ETL Job in AWS Glue: Use PySpark scripts to clean, join, and transform the data.

Output to S3: Store the transformed data back into an S3 bucket.

Optional Analysis: Load the transformed data into Power BI for insights.

Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/serverless-etl-pipeline.git
cd serverless-etl-pipeline

2. Setup AWS Environment

Configure AWS CLI:

aws configure

Create S3 buckets for raw and transformed data.

Set up AWS Glue crawlers and jobs.

3. Upload Sample Data

Upload sample CSV files to your raw data S3 bucket:

aws s3 cp ./raw-data s3://your-raw-data-bucket/ --recursive

4. Deploy AWS Glue Job

Create a new AWS Glue job.

Upload your PySpark script to S3.

Configure the Glue job to read from the raw data bucket and write to the transformed data bucket.

5. Run the ETL Job

Trigger the AWS Glue job to process and transform the data.

6. Visualize with Power BI (Optional)

Download the transformed data to your local machine and import it into Power BI for analysis.

🧠 Key Features

Serverless Architecture: Fully managed with no infrastructure to maintain.

Scalability: AWS Glue automatically scales resources as needed.

Flexible Data Transformation: Use PySpark for powerful, custom transformations.

Cost-Effective: Pay only for the resources you use.

📘 Example Use Cases

Customer segmentation based on purchase behavior.

Sales performance analysis by category and region.

Trend analysis for product demand forecasting.
