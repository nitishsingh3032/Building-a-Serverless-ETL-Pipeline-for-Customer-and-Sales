# Building-a-Serverless-ETL-Pipeline-for-Customer-and-Sales
🛠️ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using AWS Glue and Amazon S3. The goal is to process customer and sales data, transform it using AWS Glue, and store the cleaned and transformed results back to S3 for further analysis or visualization with tools like Power BI or query search with Amazon Athena.

🚀 Tech Stack

AWS S3: Storage for raw and transformed data.

AWS Glue: Serverless ETL service for data transformation.

Amazon Athena: Serverless query service to analyze data directly in S3 using SQL.

AWS IAM: Secure access management for AWS services.

Python/PySpark: For data transformation scripts.

Power BI (Optional): For visualizing the transformed data.
<h3>Power BI Visualization (Optional)</h3>
<p>Download the transformed data to your local machine and import it into Power BI for analysis.</p>

📊 Workflow

Data Ingestion: Upload raw customer and sales data (CSV, JSON, etc.) to an S3 bucket.

AWS Glue Crawler: Automatically discover the data schema and create a Data Catalog.

ETL Job in AWS Glue: Use PySpark scripts to clean, join, and transform the data.

Output to S3: Store the transformed data back into an S3 bucket.

Query with Amazon Athena: Use SQL to run ad-hoc queries directly on transformed data in S3.

Optional Analysis: Load the transformed data into Power BI for insights.

🏁 Getting Started

1. Setup AWS Environment

Configure AWS CLI:

aws configure

Create S3 buckets for raw and transformed data.

Set up AWS Glue crawlers and jobs.

Enable Amazon Athena and create a query result bucket.

2. Upload Sample Data

Upload sample CSV files to your raw data S3 bucket:

aws s3 cp ./raw-data s3://your-raw-data-bucket/ --recursive

3. Deploy AWS Glue Job

Create a new AWS Glue job.

Upload your PySpark script to S3.

Configure the Glue job to read from the raw data bucket and write to the transformed data bucket.

4. Run the ETL Job

Trigger the AWS Glue job to process and transform the data.

5. Query Data with Amazon Athena

Open the Amazon Athena console.

Create a table using the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

Write SQL queries to explore and analyze the transformed data in S3.

Example query:

SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

6. Visualize with Power BI (Optional)

Download the transformed data to your local machine and import it into Power BI for analysis.

🧠 Key Features

Serverless Architecture: Fully managed with no infrastructure to maintain.

Scalability: AWS Glue automatically scales resources as needed.

Flexible Data Transformation: Use PySpark for powerful, custom transformations.

Ad-hoc SQL Queries: Analyze data directly in S3 with Amazon Athena.

Cost-Effective: Pay only for the resources you use.

📘 Example Use Cases

Customer segmentation based on purchase behavior.

Sales performance analysis by category and region.

Trend analysis for product demand forecasting.

Real-time insights through SQL queries with Athena.
